# EPFL Bachelor Project Computer Science (Multiple files support in Scastie)

I conducted my bachelor project of Computer Science in the LAMP Lab at EPFL. The project was proposed by the Scala Center with Prof Martin Odersky and is about adding a major feature to Scastie (https://scastie.scala-lang.org), that is, Multiple files support for a website that allows people to run and share Scala code snippets.

## Abstract
Scastie is an online website that allows users to write and execute Scala code. It currently supports editing and running of only one code snippet. The goal of this project is to enhance Scastie to enable users to work with multiple files, facilitating better organization and management of complex projects.
This involves implementing a user interface for creating, opening, saving, and switching between files, as well as making backend modifications to handle multiple files effectively. The addition of multiple files support will improve the overall user experience and make Scastie a more versatile coding platform.
