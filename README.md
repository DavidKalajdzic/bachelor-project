# bachelor-project

I conducted my bachelor project of Computer Science in the LAMP Lab at EPFL. The project was proposed by the Scala Center with Prof Martin Odersky and is about adding a major feature to Scastie (Multiple files support for a website that allows people to run and share Scala code snippets).
In this repo you will find my project report as well as presentation slides.
The source code can be viewed in the fork of Scastie https://github.com/DavidKalajdzic/scastie.
